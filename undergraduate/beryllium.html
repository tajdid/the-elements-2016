If beryllium dust or fumes are inhaled, it can lead to an incurable inflammation of the lungs called berylliosis.</p> <h3 id="appearance">Appearance</h3> <p>A soft metal that ignites in the air and reacts violently with water.</p> <h3 id="uses">Uses</h3> <p>Beryllium is used in alloys with copper or nickel to make gyroscopes, springs, electrical contacts, spot-welding electrodes and non-sparking tools. Mixing beryllium with these metals increases their electrical and thermal conductivity.</p> <p>Other beryllium alloys are used as structural materials for high-speed aircraft, missiles, spacecraft and communication satellites.</p> <p>Beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays so ultra-thin beryllium foil is finding use in X-ray lithography. Beryllium is also used in nuclear reactors as a reflector or moderator of neutrons.</p> <p>The oxide has a very high melting point making it useful in nuclear work as well as having ceramic applications.</p> <h3 id="natural-abundance">Natural Abundance</h3> <p>Beryllium is found in about 30 different mineral species. The most important are beryl (beryllium aluminium silicate) and bertrandite (beryllium silicate). Emerald and aquamarine are precious forms of beryl.</p> <p>The metal is usually prepared by reducing beryllium fluoride with magnesium metal.</p> <h3 id="history">History</h3> <p>The gemstones beryl and emerald are both forms of beryllium aluminium silicate, Be3Al2(SiO3)6. The French mineralogist Abbé René-Just Haüy thought they might harbour a new element, and he asked Nicholas Louis Vauquelin, to analyse them and he realised they harboured a new metal and he investigated it. In February 1798 Vauquelin announced his discovery at the French Academy and named the element glaucinium (Greek glykys = sweet) because its compounds tasted sweet. Others preferred the name beryllium, based on the gemstone, and this is now the official name.</p> <p>Beryllium metal was isolated in 1828 by Friedrich Wöhler at Berlin and independently by Antoine-Alexandere-Brutus Bussy at Paris, both of whom extracted it from beryllium chloride (BeCl2) by reacting this with potassium.</p> <h3 id="resources">Resources</h3> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/resource/res00000405/testing-the-ph-of-oxides">Testing the pH of oxides</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/resource/res00000409/the-reactivity-of-the-group-2-metals">The reactivity of the group 2 metals</a></li> </ul> </section> <!-- /.content --> </main> <script> function goBack() { window.history.back(); } </script> <footer class="side-footer"> <p>Copyright &copy; <a href="http://tajdidrahman.co.uk">Tajdid Rahman</a> – 2016</p> </footer> </body> </html>
